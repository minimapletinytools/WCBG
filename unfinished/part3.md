cryptogames (gambling, on chain owned assets (decentraland, godz unchained), cryptokitties, space commander (just do it off chain, doesn't leverage best part s of blockchani)) Make point that most games designed aren't leveraging permeable boundary of on-chain virtual world magic circle. Too many games trying to bring existing mechanics that are either upgraded (or downgraded) by blockchain such as godz unchained and space commander. Cryptokitties was interesting and a good prototype for potential of blockchain games but no closed economy and thus no real virtual world. Gambling certainly embraces the permeable boundary (arguably no boundary) but only a more efficient version of a well established field. Existing ponzi scheme types games are worth analyzing in their own right (in particular, comparing with incremental game genre + permeable boundary) as a fascinating (and sad) social phoenemena which arguable might be a good entry point into the fomo undercurrent of ICO boom but outside the scope of this author.>

Our first remark is to say that existing blockchain projects, such as prediction markets (Augur), DAOs (too many to list) and DEXs (way too many to list) share many similarities with games. Their primary difference is that the assets are assumed to be part of the real world. We can squint our eyes until the permeable boundary between real and virtual worlds dissapears and then these examples really look no different. We can also define boundaries to these projects making them appear more game-like. DEXs work with on chain assets many of which are economically coherent on their own.. DAOs can be designed to govern the rules and economics of play which is exactly what we do in our proposed game. Prediction markets rely on the efficient market hypothesis to accurately gauge any real world sentiment which can also be applied to games and storytelling. Indeed blockchain itself can be viewed as a immensely successful virtual with its own cultural ethos, norms of play, and prominently vibrant and diverse economy. In this respect, "blockchain game" is a deliberate attempt to reduce the scope to something more in line with existing games. The full expression of play is actively being explored in the blockchain ecosystem already.

Things that are presently viewed as blockchain games, however, often do not fully leverage the permeable boundary of on-chain virtual worlds. It is the author's view that, at the time of writing (2019) too many projects approach the space by taking existing games and upgrading (or downgrading) them to use blockchain. With this view, we split games into roughly 2 categories:

1. on-chain assets, off-chain gameplay - directly addressing centralization and privacy concerns of increasingly valuable virtual worlds, games like godz unchained and decentralized entrust asset management to blockchain. This is a promising if not already proven endeavor. Players will trade their assets one way or another so why not give them ownership? For developers, this avoids needing to manage one owns assets and focus on generating new assets of value. Such efforts are still new
For example, will out of print and overpowered on-chain CCG cards ever fetch black lotus prices? Only time will tell.

2. Gambling on chain certainly embraces the permeable boundary (arguably no boundary). It is also a well established and efficient field and this author doubts that trustlessness is adds anything substantial to traditional gambling tropes. Existing ponzi scheme types games are worth analyzing in their own right. They share many similarities with the incremental game genre yet mapping to real world assets changes them entirely. It is a fascinating (and sad) social phoenemena which arguable might be a good entry point into understanding the FOMO undercurrent of ICO boom. This perspective is no so different than the thesis of this essay and is also outside the scope of this author.

<A notable exception to all this is, of course, the immensely succesful progenitor of blockchain games, cryptokitties. >
<more on cryptokitties>

<Cryptokitties -> Ethereum mainnet slowdown -> often cited as
 potential of blockchain games and need for scalability>
cryptokitties predecessor of a true blockchain game
shortcomings:
-easy breeding meant low value to non gen 0 kitties
  -even special kitties are not so unique
-no closed economic loop for extended value generation
  -eventual loss of interest reduce value of even special and gen 0 kitties
  -economy reliant on outside participation
-TBH kind of a ponzi scheme
To be clear, cryptokitties is a very succesful blockchain games and by examining areas where it fell short (long term value) we can push the boundary further and innovate.

Where as a centralized implementation for cryptokitties is indeed possible, the on chain breeding mechanics and auction markets captured the decentralized spirit of blockchain. Asset ownership and gameplay come hand in hand. In addition, games like KittyRace are only possible because blockchain allows for unrestricted and uncensorable access to the cryptokitty ERC721 tokens. The author once proposed a game that requires burning cryptokitties to feed a growing dragon and thus creating a sink for the cryptokitty economy. Gas fees and adoptions aside, whatever benefits gained from burning cryptokitties would not help you obtain more kitties limiting the scope of what's possible in this economy. Nonetheless, as the first of its kind, cryptokitties already takes strides into the vastly unexplored space of blockchain games.
